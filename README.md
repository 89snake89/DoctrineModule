# SpiffyDoctrine Module for Zend Framework 2
The SpiffyDoctrine module intends to integrate Doctrine 2 ORM with Zend Framework 2 quickly and easily. The following features are intended to work out of the box: 
  
  - ORM and MongoDB support
  - Multiple ORM/ODM managers
  - Multiple connections
  - Validators for EntityExists and NoEntityExists (ORM)
  - Authentication adapter for Zend\Authenticator (ORM)
  - Support for using existing PDO connections (ORM)
  
## Requirements
  - [Zend Framework 2](http://www.github.com/zendframework/zf2)

## Doctrine CLI
The Doctrine CLI has been pre-configured and is available in SpiffyDoctrine\bin. It should work as
is without any special configuration required.

## TODO
 - Implement migration/fixture support from doctrin-fixtures.
 - Write MORE unit tests.
