# DoctrineModule

DoctrineModule provides a bridge between Zend Framework 2 and Doctrine 2. 
It gives you access to features that can be used across Doctrine 2 ORM as well as Doctrine 2 ODM.

To use Doctrine ORM or ODM, you will need [DoctrineORMModule](https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineORMModule) 
or [DoctrineMongoODMModule](https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineMongoODMModule), respectively.
